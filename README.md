# Code With Claude

## 🚀 AI-Assisted Coding Playground

Welcome to my experimental coding playground! This repository documents my journey of collaborative coding with Claude AI from Anthropic.

### 📝 About This Project

This is a space where I'll be exploring software development with the assistance of AI. Throughout this project, I'll be:

- Building interesting applications and features
- Learning new programming techniques and patterns
- Documenting the collaborative process between human and AI
- Showcasing what's possible when creativity meets artificial intelligence

### 🔍 What To Expect

In this repository, you'll find various coding experiments, projects, and learning exercises. Each will demonstrate different aspects of AI-assisted development, from planning to implementation and testing.

### 🛠️ How It Works

1. I discuss ideas and requirements with Claude AI
2. Claude helps me plan architecture and design solutions
3. We collaboratively write code and documentation
4. I implement, test, and iterate on the code
5. The results get committed to this repository

### 🌱 Current Status

This project is just beginning! Check back soon for updates as content is added.

### 📈 Progress & Updates

- [x] Repository created
- [x] Initial README established
- [ ] First collaborative coding project
- [ ] Documentation of the process

Feel free to explore, fork, or draw inspiration from this collaboration between human creativity and AI assistance!
